1.8.2 changelog

Features:
- Clothing has been completely overhauled.
	- All clothing will be in the resources/clothing/
		- new clothing can be either added to the existing json file or it can be a new json file in that directory
	- Got rid of the old skimpiness system and replaced it with exposure.
		- All clothing have an exposure value, that is multiplied together to get your final exposure level for that slot (top or bottom)
			- Example: you're wearing panties, a skirt, a bra, and a blouse
				- panties exposure: .8
				- skirt exposure: .4
				- Total bottom exposure = .8 * .4 = .32
				- bra exposure: .8
				- blouse exposure: .3
				- Total top exposure = .3 * .8 = .24
				- Overall body exposure = (.24 + .32) / 2 = .28
			- This body exposure value increases your body's hotness stat (in this case by .28%), which in turn affects tempt and pleasure damage you do
		- To counteract the fact that wearing clothing reduces your body hotness stat, clothing now have a hotness stat as well
			- This directly adds to the hotness stat of your body while you have it on, but is reduced by the exposure level of the layers above it.
				- Example: you have a bra and a tshirt on
					- bra hotness: .4
					- tshirt hotness: .1
					- tshirt exposure: .4
					- total hotness = .1 (Tshirt) + .4(Bra) * .4(Tshirt exposure) = .26
					- If you strip off the tshirt,
					- total hotness = .4 (Bra)
			- Note that these values probably will change since I'm just trying to pick values that make sense right now
			- Hopefully this encourages people to keep their clothing on at least some of the time instead of stripping both naked within the first 2 turns.
	- Redid the mapping of the clothing. Now certain clothing can take two slots and cover both top and bottom (like trench coat and cloak)
		- top layers:
			- 0 : undershirt/bra
			- 1 : none
			- 2 : shirt/dresses
			- 3 : jackets/coats
			- 4 : cloaks etc
		- bottom layers:
			- 0 : underwear/panties
			- 1 : hosiery/leg warmers
			- 2 : pants/skirts/dresses
			- 3 : coats etc
			- 4 : cloaks etc
		- legs layer:
			- 1 : hosiery/leg warmers
			- 2 : pants
		- feet layer:
			- 1 : hosiery/leg warmers/socks
			- 2 : shoes
		- arms layer:
			- 1 : gloves
		- head layer:
			- unused for now (hats?)
		- hands layer:
			- 1 : gloves
			- 3 : unused for now (rings?)
		- neck layer:
			- unused for now (necklaces? collars?)
	- Stripping works a bit differently as well
		- Strip skills and Tear skills only shred top and bottom.
		- Random strip skills (Dissolving solution) strip any slot at random
		- Nudification skills (Defabricator, Nakedbloom, etc) will first strip top and bottom, and then strip the rest if used again.
	- Added a ton of new clothing.
		- Most of these can be found in the Boutique, Clothing Shop, or XXX Store.
		- Hover over the clothing in the store or the clothing change UI to see what they do.
	- Unfortunately this may mean that your saves are no longer compatible.
		- NEVERMIND, I MADE THEM COMPATIBLE :D
- When NPCs have affections over 30, you can give them gifts (Clothing)
	- When they have over 35 affection, they'll let you pick out their wardrobe.
	- Note that you can really screw them over by picking harmful outfits. Discretion advised.
- Added a new character initial strength Trait:
	- "Stable Form"
		- Prevents the effects of Priapus Draft, FemDraft, Tiny Draft, Bust Draft, Succubus Draft and Tentacle Tonic from applying when thrown at you.
- Added two new character initial weakness Traits:
	- "Naive"
		- 50% to not get cynical after recovering from a mindgame status (enthralled, trance, flatfooted, etc)
	- "Foot Fetishist"
		- Starts each match with a foot fetish at the minimum magnitude
- Added new Traits:
	- Heels Pro:
		- Wearing heels does not reduce your speed, and does not make you easily knocked down (generally heels have higher hotness bonuses)
	- Heels Master:
		- While wearing heels, you have a 33% chance to avoid knockdowns (Tackle, Trip, Shove, etc)
	- You gain Heels Training after finishing a battle with heels on.
		- One for heels
		- Two total for high heels
		- Three total for higher heels (Stiletto Pumps)
	- Heels Pro = 50 total training
	- Heels Master = 100 total training
- Merged in some foot fetish content from Sakruff (Thanks!)
	- Updated text on foot job/foot pump to have events for girls
	- Added a new skill Foot Smother
		- Unlocks at 20 Fetish
		- Can be used when shoeless and you are standing over the opponent
		- Has a raised chance to inflict foot fetish
- If you start off as a female or a herm, you start with bra and panties instead of boxers.
	- If you start off as a female or a herm, you start off with b cup breasts (up from flat)
- Changed the AI:
	- The AI now will consider the opponent differently. This mainly makes it so that more interesting things can be added.
	- The AI now will pick the best item to drink/throw instead of a completely random item.
	- The AI now will take the male preference slider into account when determining what move is good
		- Example: You have male preference slide all the way to the right.
				   The AI will consider growing a cock good and you getting a pussy good.
	- This is a bit experimental at the moment, so please let me know if something seems off.

Balance:
- Made divine pussy's divine charge stack double every time she takes pleasure damage instead of increasing it by .25
	- Makes getting out of vaginal penetration very important versus Angel
- Made enthrall stack less.
	- When enthralled status is added on to a already enthralled opponent, the final duration will be whatever is more:
		- Original duration + 1
		- New duration - 2 * (number of times this enthralled status has been refreshed + 1)
	- Note: If you are still having trouble with enthrall, try speccing more into Cunning.
- Fetishes now last throughout a match, but decrease in magnitude as time passes to a minimum magnitude of .25
	- Being pleasured by the fetish part will increase magnitude by .05
- Kiss of Baptism has been rebalanced a bit.
	- It now costs 30 mojo instead of building 10 mojo.
	- Now always applies Love Struck, but only for 2 turns
	- Now builds you 50% mojo
	- Now fully heals you
	- Buffed base damage bonus to 20

	
Bug fix:
- Deep kiss and drain kiss' text was swapped around
- Fixed invitation text
- Fixed some bugs with insertion requirements requiring the wrong person to be inserted.
- Fixed a text bug with alluring
- Fixed a bug where sometimes on insertion, the game would bug out
- Fixed a bug that was causing the game to bug out when transformations changed outside a match

Other changes:
- NPCs now buy priapus drafts & femdrafts based on the male pref slider. They also buy them much less than before.
- Logs now also show status effects being added and removed
- Latex clothing has been removed from the Boutique (it's purchasable in the XXX shop)

1.8.1 changelog

Major changes:
- A lot of different body modifications have been moved to specific characters. The player must build a relationship with them in order to get the mods.
	- Example: to get a succubus pussy or an incubus cock, you must have enough affection with Reyka in order to obtain it.
	There are new transformation scenes for getting each body part modification, but a lot of them are placeholds right now (Only Reyka has some finished scenes at the moment)
- Cock mods that dndw added has been refactored so that they count as modifications and not cock types. This means that you can grow and shrink them like normal.
	- Note: This was a lot more work than I originally thought, and I had to change how the BodyPart systems worked.
		Don't be too surprised to see some bugs until thing stabilize again.
		On the bright side though, it will be MUCH easier to add new types of BodyPart modifications in the future.
	- NPCs will also mod their cocks when they get one (note that it may take them a day to do it)
- Angel has been somewhat rewritten. Her upgraded class and attribute (Succubus/Dark) overlaps with Reyka too much.
	- Angel's upgraded class is now Demigoddess and preferred attribute is Divinity
		- Her level up traits have been updated to reflect this.
			- level 18 Semenphage -> Erophage (Feeds on sexuality, gains mojo/Alluring status when opponent orgasms)
			- level 33 Energydrain -> level 36 Object of Worship (Opponents is periodically forced to worship her body)
			- level 36 RawSexuality -> level 33
		- Her pussy mod has been changed from succubus to divine
			- Every time her pussy is pleasured while fucking, gain a stacking pleasure bonus. This resets when you pull out.
				Example: base divine pussy pleasureMod is 1.0
					1. You use thrust, pleasureMod bonus of +.25 = 1.25
					2. She uses ride, pleasureMod bonus of +.25 = 1.5
	- Changed the blessed cock mod to align with the Divinity Attribute and Angel. Cassie now offers the Runic cock mod instead.

Bug fix:
- Refracted Status duration, hopefully this will solve issues where statuses were not being cleared in the right order
- Fixed a bug where if both combatants had both male and female genitalia, pussy would always take priority when fucking. (It will be random for now)
	- Note that this opens up a lot more stances that weren't working before, so you may see a lot of missing/incorrect text when an unexpected situation comes up.
	- I suspect that you'll see a lot of weirdness with struggle. The effect should still work, but you might see text that wont make sense.
- Fixed a bug where loading the game could clear the malepref slider value

Balance:
- Fire form now weakens by 5 a turn instead of 1 a turn. Should still be really good.
- Flatfooted now gives you Wary after it ends instead of Cynical. (seems to make more sense)
- Nimble now gives you 2 bonus speed as well as some bonus evade based on Animism
- Flick now has a 3 turn cooldown, but causes opponent to lose 25 mojo
- Focus now reduces arousal by 20% of the cap or 20, whatever is more. It also now builds 25% Mojo. However now it has a 2 turn cooldown.
- Footjob and Foot Pump now have a base 15% chance to cause a Foot Fetish (up from 5%). This is still increased by 2% per Fetish attribute.
- Frottage now has a base 15% chance to cause a Cock Fetish (up from 5%). This is still increased by 2% per Fetish attribute.
- Assfuck now only requires 15 Seduction (down from 20)
- Sex Counter now requires 20 Seduction (up from 15)
- Grind now builds 10% Mojo (up from 5%)
- Invitation now requires 25 Seduction (up from 15), but now costs 30 Mojo (down from 50)
- Capped Kick damage at Random[0-12] + min(100, Power)
- Capped Knee damage at 4 + Random[0-11] + min(50, Power), fixed a bug where having achilles would not add bonus power.
- Capped Magic Missile damage at 100.
- Level Drain now requires 50 Dark (I see why SilverBard disabled this now...)
- Use Breasts now requires at least C cup breasts, but does not exclude Petite
- Sacrifice now costs 20 Mojo (down from 40)
- Submissive Hold now requires 15 Seduction and 15 Power (Up from 10 Seduction only)
- Tail Peg now requires 1 Dark OR 20 Seduction (changed from 2 Dark only)
- Tail Peg now continuously fucks your opponent with your tail if done while already in a sex stance
- Tail Peg now has text for players using it
- Tickle now requires 6 Cunning

Other:
- Fixed a few skills' requirements requiring one more than the intended amount of Attributes (>= instead of >)
- Update the status window instantly if your body changes.
- AI will now also grow balls if the malePref is way to the right ( > 7ish)
- Removing your dick will also remove the balls.
- Growing balls is unavailabe without growing a cock.

	- Players can get it after getting the Powerful hips trait
- Added skills LivingClothing: Self and LivingClothing: Other
	- This skill is usable with 15 science, and clothes either yourself or the opponent with tentacles.

	- Tentacle clothing does arousal damage every turn.
	- LivingClothing: Other can only be done while holding the opponent down

Other changes:
- Status panel now hides items that you have 0 of.
- Characters now have to be pleasured before they orgasm. Temptation damage is no longer sufficient
- lowered AI priority of stand up
- Changed how statuses's resource modifiers stacked
	- Multiple statuses used to stack multiplicatively
		(if you had 50% pain reduction from one status, and 50% from another, it would be 25%)
	- Now stacks additively (50% + 50% = 100% reduction)
- Changed Edging to Surrender to better reflect what it does
- Added willpower to the perception stats
