1.8.1 changelog

Major changes:
- A lot of different body modifications have been moved to specific characters. The player must build a relationship with them in order to get the mods.
	- Example: to get a succubus pussy or an incubus cock, you must have enough affection with Reyka in order to obtain it.
	There are new transformation scenes for getting each body part modification, but a lot of them are placeholds right now (Only Reyka has some finished scenes at the moment)
- Cock mods that dndw added has been refactored so that they count as modifications and not cock types. This means that you can grow and shrink them like normal.
	- Note: This was a lot more work than I originally thought, and I had to change how the BodyPart systems worked.
		Don't be too surprised to see some bugs until thing stabilize again.
		On the bright side though, it will be MUCH easier to add new types of BodyPart modifications in the future.
- Angel has been somewhat rewritten. Her upgraded class and attribute (Succubus/Dark) overlaps with Reyka too much.
	- Angel's upgraded class is now Demigoddess and preferred attribute is Divinity
		- Her level up traits have been updated to reflect this.
			- level 18 Semenphage -> Erophage (Feeds on sexuality, gains mojo/Alluring status when opponent orgasms)
			- level 33 Energydrain -> level 36 Object of Worship (Opponents is periodically forced to worship her body)
			- level 36 RawSexuality -> level 33
		- Her pussy mod has been changed from succubus to divine
			- Every time her pussy is pleasured while fucking, gain a stacking pleasure bonus. This resets when you pull out.
				Example: base divine pussy pleasureMod is 1.0
					1. You use thrust, pleasureMod bonus of +.25 = 1.25
					2. She uses ride, pleasureMod bonus of +.25 = 1.5


Bug fix:
- Refracted Status duration, hopefully this will solve issues where statuses were not being cleared in the right order
- Fixed a bug where if both combatants had both male and female genitalia, pussy would always take priority when fucking. (It will be random for now)

Balance:
- Fire form now weakens by 5 a turn instead of 1 a turn. Should still be really good.
- Flatfooted now gives you Wary after it ends instead of Cynical. (seems to make more sense)
- Nimble now gives you 2 bonus speed as well as some bonus evade based on Animism
- Flick now has a 3 turn cooldown, but causes opponent to lose 25 mojo
- Focus now reduces arousal by 20% of the cap or 20, whatever is more. It also now builds 25% Mojo. However now it has a 2 turn cooldown.
- Footjob and Foot Pump now have a base 15% chance to cause a Foot Fetish (up from 5%). This is still increased by 2% per Fetish attribute.
- Frottage now has a base 15% chance to cause a Cock Fetish (up from 5%). This is still increased by 2% per Fetish attribute.
- Assfuck now only requires 15 Seduction (down from 20)
- Sex Counter now requires 20 Seduction (up from 15)
- Grind now builds 10% Mojo (up from 5%)
- Invitation now requires 25 Seduction (up from 15), but now costs 30 Mojo (down from 50)
- Capped Kick damage at Random[0-12] + min(100, Power)
- Capped Knee damage at 4 + Random[0-11] + min(50, Power), fixed a bug where having achilles would not add bonus power.
- Capped Magic Missile damage at 100.
- Level Drain now requires 50 Dark (I see why SilverBard disabled this now...)
- Use Breasts now requires at least C cup breasts, but does not exclude Petite
- Sacrifice now costs 20 Mojo (down from 40)
- Submissive Hold now requires 15 Seduction and 15 Power (Up from 10 Seduction only)
- Tail Peg now requires 1 Dark OR 20 Seduction (changed from 2 Dark only)
- Tail Peg now continuously fucks your opponent with your tail if done while already in a sex stance
- Tail Peg now has text for players using it
- Tickle now requires 6 Cunning

Other:
- Fixed a few skills' requirements requiring one more than the intended amount of Attributes (>= instead of >)

1.7.6 changelog

- Fixed a bug where you could grow multiple breasts/cocks if you had them temporarily changed.
- Use Breasts is no longer usable while mounted facing chest/behind/in other weird situations.
- Tighten can no longer be used when the opponent has a strapon
- Fixed a bug where ineffective panties would still obstruct reverse fucking

New:
- Added the Trait Insertion Master (better name needed)
	- Increases base pleasure damage of fucking (but not thrusting/grinding/etc) by min(seduction / 4, 40)
	- Angel gets this trait at 24 and Reyka at 17
	- Players can get it after getting the Powerful hips trait
- Added skills LivingClothing: Self and LivingClothing: Other
	- This skill is usable with 15 science, and clothes either yourself or the opponent with tentacles.
	- The only difference between the two other than the target is that the ones for the opponent is ineffective (does not block fucking etc)
	- Tentacle clothing does arousal damage every turn.
	- LivingClothing: Other can only be done while holding the opponent down

Other changes:
- Status panel now hides items that you have 0 of.
- Characters now have to be pleasured before they orgasm. Temptation damage is no longer sufficient
- lowered AI priority of stand up
- Changed how statuses's resource modifiers stacked
	- Multiple statuses used to stack multiplicatively
		(if you had 50% pain reduction from one status, and 50% from another, it would be 25%)
	- Now stacks additively (50% + 50% = 100% reduction)
- Changed Edging to Surrender to better reflect what it does
- Added willpower to the perception stats
