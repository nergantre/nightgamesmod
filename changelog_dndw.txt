16/06/16 - 2.0.4
-Fixed bug where unlocking new competitors allowed the player to end up with a negative amount of money.
-Merged in fixes to the start configuration mechanism by Ryplinn.
-Some small fixes.

28/05/16 - 2.0.3.1
-Fixed trophies not being set correctly for custom starts.

28/05/16 - 2.0.3
-Added start configurations:
	-These alter the starting conditions of your game. Pretty much anything can be altered, different characters with different traits, different bodyparts, different attributes, even different names.
	-"Default" is the plain old start, with no changes.
	-"Default Verbose" is pretty much the same as Default, except that it explicitly sets default options instead of allowing the game to infer them. This is mainly so you can see most options if you want to make a configuration yourself.
	-"NewGame+" starts with all characters unlocked and with their post-level 10 classes and bodies. They also gain a boost to their attributes, but start at level 1. The player gets extra attribute points to compensate, but cannot pick any advanced attributes.
	-"Angels and Demons" pits three Angels (Angel, Cassie, Mara) against three Demons (Reyka, Eve, Jewel), and puts the player in the middle. Attributes are similar to New Game+. Cassie, Mara, Eve and Jewel also get their own advanced features, while Angel and Reyka get a bonus to theirs. The player also get bonus points.
	-"Inverted Genders" is just that: the player is a female, the others are male. They have their names changed, but that doesn't work everywhere. Lots of things will break, but not unplayably. It works fine, as long as you don't take it too seriously.
	-There is a description of all available options in the "starts" folder, which is also where the configurations are stored.

26/05/16 - 2.0.2

-Added Kat's Breeder addiction. You get it by her biting you during sex, and can worsen it by fucking her (or being bitten again). It increases pleasure from fucking Kat, allows her to use Invitation without mojo, keeps you from pulling out at high levels, and allows the use and increases the damage of Wild Thrust. At high levels, it makes the player Feral, which reduces willpower loss but maintains half of your arousal on orgasm. In withdrawal, it causes a permanent Horny causing arousal over time.
-Added Bite, which can only be used by Kat. It has no effects beside the addiction.
-Relocated the withdrawal check so that the relevant message(s) are printed without being immediately removed again...
-Witdrawal effects now refresh every turn, both in and out of combat. This shouldn't have any effect on existing content, just for the Horny mentioned above.
-All (hopefully) of the game now compares characters by type instead of name. This may prevent some bugs in future plans.

(This was changed in 2.0.0, but not mentioned: Frenzied characters can no longer use Engulf)

08/05/16 - 1.9.6

-Added a framework for long-lasting addictions. These are built up over time with specific actions and have severe negative consequences if they get too strong. They can be reduced by not indulging for a while, but that does cause withdrawal effects. All addictions are unlocked at level 20.
-Incorporated Cassie's Magic Milk addiction by nergantre. You get addicted by drinking (or being forced to drink) her milk. It causes willpower loss when fighting Cassie, and when in withdrawal it limits total willpower.
-Added Angel's Zeal. This is an addiction gained by cumming while fucking Angel. It 'encourages' you to take submissive positions while fighting her. In withdrawal, it limits mojo gain. (Crisis of Faith) If you worship Angel during the day, she gets a permanent Divine Charge the next night.
-Added Reyka's Corruption. Gained by repeatedly coming into contact with her lips, or by cumming inside of her after penetrating her voluntarily (only if you are already corrupted to some degree, see below). It will transform random attribute points to Dark, and transform your body into a demon once it's done. In withdrawal it causes random negative effects. (Dark Chaos)
-The game now tracks who initiated penetration, and whether or not it was voluntary. If the initiator was under some form of mind control, it wasn't voluntary. In the case of counters, the character who used the counter is the initiator, not the one who triggered it.
-Dissolve now prioritizes tops and bottoms before dissolving shoes and the like. I'm not too certain about this one.
-Fixed Leech Energy's ridiculously low accuracy. Must have been a typo. (7->80)
-Added Pray. Only available to a player afflicted with Zeal, but not while fighting Angel. It boosts willpower.
-Added Prostrate. Usable only while having Zeal and fighting Angel. Lay down in front of her. This reduces the strength of the addiction during the current fight, but increases long-term addiction.
-Added Dark Kiss. Usable only while Corrupted. It reduces the target's willpower and temporarily reduces Corruption, but increases the long-term addiction.
-Fixed a whole lot of bugs and text issues.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________


Merged in invalidcharacter's GUI changes

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Original changes:

Added special text for Eve using AssFuck
Added trait AnalFanatic - boosts pleasure to both parties when having anal sex and makes the holder Frenzied for the duration (Surprise, Eve gets this)
Frenzied now boosts Power and Animism more than before, and reduces damage taken
Made the 'Mystery NPC' vastly more powerful to deal with the mod allowing higher damage and limits
Fixed the Experienced trait doing the opposite of what it's supposed to
Added '.ngs' extension to the autosave so the load dialog can see it straight away
Fixed a bug where Enthralling Trap could force a character to move back and forth if they can't fight their 'master' (thanks to ReliableNarrator)
Fixed a fatal bug for the Slime where it could destroy the wrong article of clothing
Various small fixes, mostly text related
CockGrowth now has an actual accuracy calculation instead of a flat 0
Escape is somewhat more likely to work in escaping stances
Added Imbue Fetish, which bestows a somewhat-random fetish on the target. Requires Fetish >= 10
Added Assjob - Descriptions written by CharredNewt
Added TailSuck and a status it can cause; Requires the EnergyDrain trait
Fixed LevelDrain giving the target Satiated instead of the user
Fixed EnthrallingTrap not having a string representation for use in the button (You can only see this under the influence of a Succubus Draft)
Generalized the structure for match modifiers (like underwear only, hypersensitivity cream, etc.) so they are easier to add. They can be created in JSON, too, though not with full functionality yet.
Completely remade the way NPCs handle enthralled opponents. It's now less powerful and more random.
Fixed stripping checks causing a crash if the character is naked.
Made Undress and Masturbate much less likely to be picked by the AI
(Probably) Fixed body modification skills causing changes in simulation. (Temporary changes were prevented, permanent ones weren't)
Added a duration to fetishes.
Finished Airi, who has been partially implemented for a long time. She's a slime, and will appear when you reach level 10.

Slime characteristics:
	Enhanced Slap - chance of knockdown.
	Enhanced Trip - higher success chance.
	Enhanced Dissolve - does not require items.
	Lower pain taken
	Can grow/remove genitals for a small amount of Mojo.
	Can use Spores, which force the opponent to use skills that can trigger counters
	Can use Engulf, which is a counter similar to Rosea's: it only hits on the turn after it is deployed.
		-It is a very, very bad idea to attack a slime the turn after they use Engulf
		-The Engulfed position dissolves all of the target's clothes and it's a fucking stance.
		-Aside from regular fucking skills, Multi Fuck allows the slime to use all genitals the two combatants have at once.
	Slimy Cock:
		-Can 'burn' through underwear, so you can use insertion skills while the opponent is wearing underwear.
		-Causes Horny when it is pulled out, due to some slime remaining inside.
	Gooey Pussy:
		-Weakly binds any cock inside of it. (Not as strong as vaginal tongue, for example)
		-Causes passive damage per turn. Like autonomous pussy, but not as powerful.
		-Causes greater Willpower loss if a cock cums inside of it.

Added a new match type, the FTC Match (Fuck the Carrier). It will trigger for the first time after reaching level 15, at then randomly (rarely) after that.
		
FTC Match:
-There are four hunters and one prey.
-The prey is naked and cannot have items.
-At the start of the match, the prey gets a Flag.
-The prey gets one point for every three turns they hold the Flag.
-If whoever is holding the Flag gets defeated, the winner takes the Flag.
-Each player has one base where they can resupply.
-The hunters can turn in the Flag at their base for five points.
-If the prey beats a hunter, they gain three points.
-Hunters get two points for beating other hunters, but no points for beating the prey.
-When a hunter turns in the Flag, the prey can collect a new one at their base.
-When the prey gets a new Flag, they cannot be attacked for a short time.
